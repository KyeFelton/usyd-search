## usydSearch: an ontology-driven search engine for the University of Sydney
usydSearch is a ReactJS application for querying usydKnowledge, a knowledge graph constructed for the University of Sydney. Incorporating [Stardog](https://www.stardog.com/)'s search capabilities, usydSearch translates user input into structured queries to retrieve relevant entities from the knowledge base.

This project was pursued as part of my honours degree at the University of Sydney.
